State FB: Optimizes K matrix to try and get a good state feedback law
Control Traj: Optimizes a trajectory of n control inputs, which are interpolated to give control input at each time step

To Do:
Start both optimizations brim LQR maybe?
Find some better starting point
PID optimization
Other controller optimization
